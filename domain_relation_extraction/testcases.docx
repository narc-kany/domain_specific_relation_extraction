A new study published in the New England Journal of Medicine suggests that statin medications may reduce the risk of heart attacks by up to 30% in high-risk patients. Researchers found that patients taking atorvastatin showed significantly lower levels of LDL cholesterol and fewer cardiovascular events compared to the placebo group. However, the study noted an increased incidence of muscle pain as a side effect in approximately 5% of participants.

**RW-3: Healthcare Research Abstract**
```
Background: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) increases the risk of cardiovascular disease. This study evaluated whether empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, reduces cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with T2DM and established cardiovascular disease.

Methods: We randomly assigned patients to receive either empagliflozin (10 mg or 25 mg) or placebo once daily. The primary outcome was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke.

Results: A total of 7,020 patients were treated (empagliflozin, n=4,687; placebo, n=2,333) for a median of 3.1 years. The primary outcome occurred in 10.5% of patients in the empagliflozin group and in 12.1% of those in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.86; 95% confidence interval, 0.74 to 0.99; P=0.04). Empagliflozin treatment was associated with lower rates of hospitalization for heart failure and lower rates of death from any cause.
